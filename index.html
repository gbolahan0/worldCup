          <h1>The 2022 WORLD CUP</h1>
          <p>
            Qatar is hosting the 2022 world cup. The world cup takes place every
            four years. and the following one will take place this year. This is
            a really memorable occasion for many football fans, but this year is
            a little different because it's the final dance for the goats
            Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Will this be the year that one
            of them finally wins the coveted crown after years of trying?

          <p>
            Argentina and Messi coming into the world cup with a 36 game
            unbeaten streak are one of the favourites for the world cup.

          <p>
            Portugal may not be the best team by all standards but they are one
            of the favourites because of their man Ronaldo.

          <p>
            The french men may have lost some of their best players to injury,
            but are still a very solid team and one of the favourites

          <p>
            Brazil probably with the best team in the world cup, lead by one of
            the most in-form players in Neymar jr. are probably the favourites
            for this cup

        My favourites for this world cup is both Brazil and Portugal. Portugal
        because i would love to see Ronaldo win the world cup and Brazil because
        they have a really good squad. But i have a feeling argentina would do
        really well. Nigeria didn't qualify but i doubt if they had a chance to
        win it.
