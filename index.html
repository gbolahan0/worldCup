          <h1>The 2022 WORLD CUP</h1>
          <p>
            Qatar is hosting the 2022 world cup. The world cup takes place every
            four years. and the following one will take place this year. This is
            a really memorable occasion for many football fans, but this year is
            a little different because it's the final dance for the goats
            Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Will this be the year that one
            of them finally wins the coveted crown after years of trying?

          <p>
            Argentina and Messi coming into the world cup with a 36 game
            unbeaten streak are one of the favourites for the world cup.

          <p>
            Portugal may not be the best team by all standards but they are one
            of the favourites because of their man Ronaldo.

          <p>
            The french men may have lost some of their best players to injury,
            but are still a very solid team and one of the favourites

          <p>
            Brazil probably with the best team in the world cup, lead by one of
            the most in-form players in Neymar jr. are probably the favourites
            for this cup

      <p>
        Brazil and Portugal are both among my favorites for this world cup.
        Brazil because they have an extremely strong team, and Portugal because
        I would want to see Cristiano Ronaldo win the world cup. However, I
        think Argentina would perform exceptionally well. Nigeria didn't make
        the cut, but I don't think they had much of a chance to win.
